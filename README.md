# shortest-path-finder
This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in computer science, widely used in network routing, geographical mapping, and various other applications requiring efficient pathfinding.

	•	Efficient Pathfinding: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
	•	Customizable Graph Input: Supports user-defined graphs with adjustable weights.
	•	Visualization: (Optional) Visual representation of the graph and the shortest path.
	•	Modular Code: Clean, modular, and well-documented code for easy understanding and modification.
