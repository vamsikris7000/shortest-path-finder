Dijkstra-Travel-Planner
=======================

	•	Efficient Pathfinding: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
	•	Customizable Graph Input: Supports user-defined graphs with adjustable weights.
	•	Visualization: (Optional) Visual representation of the graph and the shortest path.
	•	Modular Code: Clean, modular, and well-documented code for easy understanding and modification.
